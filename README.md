Parabolic Reflector for 4G Internet Access

This project demonstrates how to build a custom parabolic reflector to enhance 4G internet connectivity in rural or remote areas. The reflector design is based on a self-made structure using readily available materials, with the goal of improving signal reception using a 4G modem and feed antenna. For more details refer to the report file Parabolic_reflector_RU.pdf (Russian) or Parabolic_reflector_Eng.pdf (English). 

KEY FEATURES:
  Design & Construction:
    Detailed algorithm for cutting parabolic reflector segments (petals) from different materials.
    Instructions for constructing the protective spherical housing for the reflector.
    Python code to generate the reflectorâ€™s profile, cut templates, and calculate signal gain.
  Customization:
    Adaptable for various reflector sizes and materials such as cardboard, plywood, or composites.
    Easy-to-follow assembly and installation steps for use in attic spaces or on poles.
  Signal Optimization:
    Guidance for selecting the optimal azimuth angle based on geographic location and nearest cellular towers.
    Real-world results of signal enhancement and performance testing.
