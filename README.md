PARABOLIC REFLECTOR FOR 4G INTERNET ACCESS

This project demonstrates how to build a custom parabolic reflector to enhance 4G internet connectivity in rural or remote areas. The reflector design is based on a self-made structure using readily available materials, with the goal of improving signal reception using a 4G modem and MIMO/SISO feed antenna. For more details refer to the report file Parabolic_reflector_Ru.pdf (Russian) or Parabolic_reflector_Eng.pdf (English). 

KEY FEATURES:

  Design & Construction:
  
    Detailed algorithms for cutting parabolic reflector and sphere petals.
    
    Python codes to generate the reflectorâ€™s and sphere's petal profiles.

    Instructions for constructing the protective spherical housing for the reflector.

    Instructions for selecting 4G modems and MIMO/SISO feed antennae. 
    
  Customization:
  
    Adaptable for various reflector sizes and materials such as cardboard, plywood, or composites.
    
    Easy-to-follow assembly and installation steps for use in attic spaces.
    
  Signal Optimization:
  
    Guidance for selecting the optimal azimuth angle based on geographic location and nearest cellular towers.
    
    Real-world results of signal enhancement and performance testing.

GETTING STARTED:

1. Clone the repository:
   
    git clone https://github.com/DYK-Team/Parabolic_reflector.git

2. Set up Python environment:
   
    pip install numpy csv

3. Run calculations:

    Modify the Parabolic_reflector.py or Sphere.py script with your desired parameters.
  
    Use the generated profiles for cutting the petals and assembling the reflector or sphere.
