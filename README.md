PARABOLIC REFLECTOR FOR 4G INTERNET ACCESS

This project demonstrates how to build a custom parabolic reflector to enhance 4G internet connectivity in rural or remote areas. The reflector design is based on a self-made structure using readily available materials, with the goal of improving signal reception using a 4G modem and feed antenna. For more details refer to the report file Parabolic_reflector_Ru.pdf (Russian) or Parabolic_reflector_Eng.pdf (English). 

KEY FEATURES:

  Design & Construction:
  
    Detailed algorithm for cutting parabolic reflector segments (petals) from different materials.
    
    Instructions for constructing the protective spherical housing for the reflector.
    
    Python codes to generate the reflectorâ€™s and sphere's petal profiles.
    
  Customization:
  
    Adaptable for various reflector sizes and materials such as cardboard, plywood, or composites.
    
    Easy-to-follow assembly and installation steps for use in attic spaces.
    
  Signal Optimization:
  
    Guidance for selecting the optimal azimuth angle based on geographic location and nearest cellular towers.
    
    Real-world results of signal enhancement and performance testing.

GETTING STARTED:

1. Clone the repository:
   
    git clone https://github.com/DYK-Team/Parabolic_reflector.git

2. Set up Python environment:
   
    pip install numpy csv

3. Run calculations:

    Modify the Parabolic_reflector.py or Sphere.py script with your desired parameters for the reflector or sphere radius, focal length, and number of petals.
  
    Use the generated profiles for cutting the petals and assembling the reflector or sphere.
